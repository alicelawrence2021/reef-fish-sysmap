### Project objectives: ### 

- Socio-ecological coral reef fish studies: what spatial and temporal scales have been used? 

- Understand the mismatches between the scale of empirical observations (ecological & social) AND 
that scale at which management inferences are made

- Identify gaps in evidence base â€“ systematic, transparent and repeatable

### Goals for the week: ### 

- How to integrate  quantitative ecological metadata with qualitative social metadata? 

- Can we develop an automated conversion factor based on geographical area and/or population of the study country?
