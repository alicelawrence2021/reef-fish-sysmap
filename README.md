Project objectives: 

- Socio-ecological coral reef fish studies: what spatial and temporal scales have been used? 

- Understand the scale mismatch between:  
empirical / field observations (ecological & social)
management recommendations and inferences made

- Identify gaps in evidence base â€“ systematic, transparent and repeatable

Methods protocol published January 2021, [read here](rdcu.be/cecKn)

Goals for the week:

- How to integrate  quantitative ecological metadata with qualitative social metadata? 

- Can we develop an automated conversion factor based on geographical area and/or population of the study country?
