## What's it all about?

### Project Name: ###

The spatio-temporal scales of coral reef fish ecological research and management: a systematic evidence map

### Project Background: ### 

Use a systematic map process to understand:

- What spatial and temporal scales have been used in socio-ecological coral reef fish studies over the last 10 years

- The mismatches between the scale of empirical observations (ecological & social) AND the scale at which management inferences are made

- What gaps are in the evidence base, in a  systematic, transparent and repeatable way

### Goals for the week: ### 

- How best to integrate quantitative ecological metadata with qualitative social metadata

- Can we develop an automated conversion factor based on geographical area and/or population of the study country?


### Workflow: ### 


1. Data organisation - focus on key categories

from this...

to this...

2. Solutions for integrating qualitative and quantitative data

convert quantitative ecological scale to a qualitative scale similar to social scale categories

3. Data visualisation - better understanding of how to extract the data more effectively


***insert images***
- heat map
- surface plot - 3D
- map - Using population/ marine area to investigate patterns in scale mismatches between data collection and management inferences (how different in smaller island states). Possibly use GDP to identify differences related to the economy.



### Lessons Learned: ### 

- how to use git hub effectively

- streamlined collaboration platforms

- reproducible workflows - how to organise project files and scripts before the next phase

****from organising and visualising the data - new ideas / categories / reduction of effort needed

****how will benefit the larger project - tools for the next phase, better preparation




### Next steps: ### 

- amend metadata extraction questions (reduce length - will reduce reviewer time)

- ecological scale - consider just using categorical scale - substantial reduction in reviewer time

- social scale - if want to quantify - need more time to calculate average village /  district sizes in each country

***tools learned about
- colandr
- machine learning - easy data extraction e.g. locations
- Environmental evidence database
